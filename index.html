          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My journey to become a full-stack developer began in 2019 with a 
            workshop at Epicodus!  I found that I really enjoyed both the technical 
            and creative aspects that came with software development and web design.</p>
          <p>I began with the cohort in March and found that I could use some more time with the 
            material, especially JavaScript.  And so a plan was developed to begin again in May with the C# cohort.
